## Pokemon Database
A collection of data about a Pokemon including their name, HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed stats.
There is also a derived field describing their specialty being either physical, special, or mixed depending on if the Pokemon's
Attack or Special Attack is higher by a significant amount. It also can either be a sweeper, staller, or generalist depending
on whether it is more offense or defense oriented.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Tested with Smith.

      Smith
      Problems:
      - Modifying the data was not intuitive
      - Entering data was case sensitive which was not specified

      I wasn't surprised by the modify being unintuitive, but I completely forgot to testing case sensitivity somehow

      Changes:
      - I altered the buttons to make it more clear. 
      - The case sensitive was kind of a surprise but I made it so it ignores casing.
- **Design Achievement 2**: Changed font to Comic Sans because it can help people with dyslexia
- **Design Achievement 3**: Changed the coloring of the datatable to make it stand out using element selectors
- **Design Achievement 4**: Changed the color of the buttons using id selectors
- **Design Achievement 5**: Changed the font family and size of the title and instructions using class selectors
